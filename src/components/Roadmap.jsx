            <h3>2020 — First Contact with Code</h3>
            <p>
              I discovered programming and began my journey by learning the basics of <strong>HTML</strong>. 
              This initial exposure sparked my curiosity and opened the door to the world of web development.

            <h3>2021 — Building Static Websites</h3>
            <p>
              I started exploring <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and created my first simple 
              websites. I became familiar with the structure and behavior of web pages and developed a deeper interest 
              in front-end development.

            <h3>2022 — Academic Foundations</h3>
            <p>
              I enrolled in a Computer Engineering program, where I focused on programming fundamentals, algorithmic 
              thinking, and problem solving using <strong>C++</strong>. These concepts helped me build a solid technical base.

            <h3>2023 – 2025 — Real-World Development & Freelance Work</h3>
            <p>
              I advanced both academically and through self-learning. I gained hands-on experience using version control 
              tools like <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>, developed dynamic applications with 
              <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, and expanded into backend technologies such as 
              <strong>Python</strong> with <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>FastAPI</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Express</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also worked with <strong>WebSockets</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong> databases, <strong>Google OAuth</strong>, and followed best practices using <strong>MVC architecture</strong> and <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time, I built several personal projects and collaborated on freelance work, applying my skills 
              in real-world scenarios and delivering functional, user-focused solutions.
